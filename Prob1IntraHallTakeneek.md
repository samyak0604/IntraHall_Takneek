# Problem 1(Intra Hall Takneek)
We are given an audio file and an image file that contain some kind of hidden text.
The image file consists of letters written in hexahue code. 
On translating the hexahue code, we get "KSHATRIYATAKNEEK"
For the audio file, we tried to analyse the spectrogram of the audio file to find any hidden text. It didn't yield any results. We further tried to find any hidden text in the audio file using steganography tools like exiftool, strings, etc. which remained unsuccesful.
